Bonus:

1. Added an animation to show the path with clever use of setInterval()
2. Gave each player 30 seconds total for their decision making!
3. Adjustable player switch and board size configuration in a modal screen.

I think these three additions combined should contribute to a bonus point - as they go above and beyond the specified requirements and provide nice visual feedback and add a more competitive and 'game-like' element to the project.
